# Pathways
A repo to document the useful information and resources I come across in my goal to become a shadowy super dev and a loose pathways for others who have similar aspirations.

# Ethereum basics
https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/tokens#ERC20
https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/

# Practice Solidity Dev
https://cryptozombies.io/ 
- Good beginner walkthrough that takes you through Solidity Development as well as Javascript to interact with contracts.

https://buildspace.so/ 
- Buildspace is great to give an overview of developing and deploying dApp's end-to-end. From contract deployment to front end. A step up from cryptozimbies in that you will become familiar with Hardhat, deployment to test/mainnet and contract testing.

# Learn Solidity Security
Secureum - https://github.com/x676f64/secureum-mind_map 
- Great repo of the Secureum bootcamp content that will take you from zero to hero (or at least familiar) with SOlidity security concepts.


# Practice Solidity Security
https://github.com/blockthreat/blocksec-ctfs - Nice repo of Ethereum CTF's as well as writeups from some giga brains.


# Tools
Metamask  
Remix  
Hardhat  
VisualStudio Code  
  Extensions:  
[Solhint](https://protofire.github.io/solhint/) - keeping your code "clean"   
[Slither](https://github.com/crytic/slither) - open source suite of vulnerability detectors. Prints visua information about contract details.  
Echidna - Fuzzing/property based testing. Uses sophisticated grammar based fuzzing campaigns  
[Security Toolbox](https://github.com/trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox) Docker image with security toolset
